# 
# ```tcl
# proc enabletrace {} {
#   global vmd_frame;
#   trace variable vmd_frame([molinfo top]) w drawcounter
# }

# This is a procedure named `enabletrace` that doesn't take any arguments. It declares `vmd_frame` as a global variable. The `trace` command is used to call the `drawcounter` procedure whenever the `vmd_frame` of the top molecule changes.
# 
# ```tcl
# proc disabletrace {} {
#   global vmd_frame;
#   trace vdelete vmd_frame([molinfo top]) w drawcounter
# }
# ```
# This is a procedure named `disabletrace` that also doesn't take any arguments. It declares `vmd_frame` as a global variable. The `trace vdelete` command is used to stop calling the `drawcounter` procedure when the `vmd_frame` of the top molecule changes.
# 
# ```tcl
# proc drawcounter {name element op} {
#   global vmd_frame;
#   draw delete all
#   draw color black
#   set psperframe 2
#   set psoffset 0
#   set time [format "%d ps" [expr ($vmd_frame([molinfo top]) * $psperframe) + $psoffset]]
#   draw text {70 0 10} "$time"
# }
# ```
# This is a procedure named `drawcounter` that takes three arguments: `name`, `element`, and `op`. It declares `vmd_frame` as a global variable. The `draw delete all` command is used to clear all previous drawings. The `draw color black` command sets the drawing color to black. The `set psperframe 2` and `set psoffset 0` commands set the time step and offset for each frame. The `set time` command calculates the current time in picoseconds and formats it as a string. The `draw text {70 0 10} "$time"` command draws the time string at the coordinates `{70 0 10}`.
# 
# You can adjust the `psperframe`, `psoffset`, and text coordinates according to your needs. Remember to call `enabletrace` to start showing the time label, and `disabletrace` to stop it. Happy scripting! ðŸ˜ŠSure, I'd be happy to explain the script line by line:
